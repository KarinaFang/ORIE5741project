What is it about?
What data are they using?
What is their objective?
What I like?
What can be improved?
What other questions the group should consider?

The group is trying to build a model to predict the possibiity of testing positive given characteristeristics 
of certain patients and priortrize the individuals and allocate the testing kits more efficiently. In order to fullfill
their goal, they are using the Aggregated Us survey data which is made available to the public by CMU.
I like the way how they describe the data so that I know the data is collected aimed to help researchers to monitor and forecast 
the spread of the disease. This description means the data set has specific aim.
The second point I like is that they indicated the characteristic of the entire dataset which brings me a general idea about the dataset
and what kind of model should I expect.
The third point I like is that they got a dataset with good quality and a dataset with good quality is the first step for success in the model.
One suggestion is that they can mention some basic parameters they have in their dataset and what parameters are they going to use in their
model. They can list parameters as much as possible and delete them later according to the significance level.
Another suggestion is that in the proposal, they can separate the paragraphs by some titles so that audience can directly know what each part
serves for.
One last suggestion is that they can consider some demographic parameters besides symptom data, as different location and different density of 
populated may also has effect on positive rate and possibility.
One concern I have is that there are too many useful parameters, how the model gonna group them and generate a descent result? Will it cause some
overfitting or underfitting problems?
