In the year 2020, the world suffered from an unprecedented pandemic COVID-19. To circumvent the constraints of quarantine and testing on a large scale, it is vital to answer the question: Can we predict the possibility of testing positive given the characteristics of a certain patient. In this project, we want to use the computational method we learned in class to help determine whether there is an approach to identify symptoms to help with early detection of COVID-19 in the United States. Our goal is to analyze the covid testing data and identify the best features we can use to predict the possibility of testing positive. We plan on answering the following questions:

  1. How to select symptom features to predict covid positive?

  2. What is the optimal model we can use to analyze the data?
  
  3. What is the relationship between the characteristics of patients and the possibility of testing positive?

With the COVID-19 Symptom Survey data provided by CMU, we are planning to use the overall-state-smoothed data to build our model. The relationship between testing results and significant symptom signals can be discovered by interpreting the coefficients, and the model can be improved by picking different model classes, which would eventually lead us to find an effective model to answer the question.
